# PLAY-STORE-APP-REVIEW-ANALYSIS
I'm performing a comprehensive analysis of Google Play Store data using Python for the first time. The study focuses on gaining a deeper understanding of the Android app market by examining more than 10,000 apps in different categories. The goal is to identify trends and develop strategies to increase growth and retention in the app market.

# Google Play Store App Analysis

The Google Play Store is one of the largest and most popular Android app stores, serving as the official app store for the Android operating system. It provides a platform for users to browse and download applications developed with the Android software development kit and published through Google. With its vast amount of data, conducting analysis and prediction on the Google Play Store dataset can provide valuable insights for app developers and businesses.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to perform data analysis and prediction on the Google Play Store application dataset. The dataset contains 13 different features that can be used to predict the success of an app using various factors. Additionally, we have user review data that includes 5 different features.

The analysis is divided into three phases: data extraction, data cleaning, and data visualization. 

1. Data Extraction: We collect the data from the Google Play Store website, ensuring we have a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

2. Data Cleaning: In this phase, we perform data cleaning techniques to reduce errors and inconsistencies in the dataset. This step is crucial to ensure the accuracy of our analysis.

3. Data Visualization: After preparing the dataset, we analyze it using different plots and visualizations to gain insights and identify patterns. We remove unnecessary data to focus on the areas of interest and provide a clear vision of the relationships within the dataset.

## Problem Statement

The primary objective of this project is to explore the Google Play Store dataset and answer key questions related to app categories, ratings, prices, app size, reviews, and user sentiments. By addressing these questions, we aim to provide actionable insights for developers and businesses to enhance their app-making strategies and capture the Android market effectively.
